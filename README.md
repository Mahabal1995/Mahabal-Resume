My Resume
This repo contains code for a simple website that defines my personal portfolio
I have used plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript to implement this very simple interactive website
I have done this after learning React, and I got to know how React reduces the pain of developers to a far more extent
This was a great learning for me.....
